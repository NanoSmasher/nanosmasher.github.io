We are back in business! This is the new location of my old [Brampton Booster](http://bramptonbooster.wordpress.com/). As you may or may not tell, there are a lot of exciting details for everyone. The ones that would concern you the most are:

- Faster loading times. Wordpress and other bloatware trimmed out to speed up blog. 
- No Ads. This goes hand in hand with faster loading times, but now you have no obstructions in reading solid articles
- IntenseDebate comment system. Has a ranking system and smart threading to make sure good discussions stay on top.
- Interactive elements. Check out the Hypergeometric Calculator on the side, or the program below.
- Open source. The blog is hosted on Github, so just [head over to my repo](http://github.com/nanosmasher/nanosmasher.github.io) to suggest changes or use ideas for your own blog.


My philosophy is having straight and to-the-point content is most important for readers. This is why my blog has a small navbar and quick access elements so you are only 2 clicks away from every single article I publish. However I also believe there must also be some form of involvement from the reader. Text, images, and videos are very minimal and its information are more or less taken for granted. The goal of this blog is to try and get readers to put effort into learning the theory and logic so they can verify everything is correct, which they can extend to all sorts of problems.

### 1. Interactive elements

Get them to do the math by themselves, or provide them with an open ended scenario and see the results. It will not be possible to have interactivity for absolutely everything, but at the very least they will not be limited to just reading.

For example, let's take the Hypergeometric Calculator on the right. I say that the chance to get at least one trigger from a twin drive check is approximately 55%. Can you verify this is in fact correct? Well you know a standard deck contains 50 cards, with 16 of them triggers. So you can put z=50 and and w=16. Twin drive involves removing 2 cards from the deck so y=2. Lastly we want at lease 1 trigger so we set u=1 and hit <pre>Evaluate</pre>.

Chance >= 1: 54.2%. Pretty good. Now you can try it at turn 3 where you are expected to have 36-38 cards and 11-13 triggers. Heck, you might not even use it for card games. Say 80% in your class of 30 had a cold and you want to pick out 3 students. If you put in the numbers correctly, then almost half the time all 3 students would have a cold!

So you can play around with this and see different percentages. You can then look at the [source code]({{ site.baseurl}}/cfvg/program/hgcc.js) and understand how the answer is evaluated. Or you can search online for a [different site](http://stattrek.com/online-calculator/hypergeometric.aspx) and compare values. So have fun and learn the math at the same time.

### 2. Testing Database

Being open and transparent is necessary for trust in results when you do not have the time effort to be as involved, yet you don't just want to take advice at a face value. I am currently developing a program that will track every game played and its various notes, so you can expect to find quality information before you decide to invest money into a specific build.

While it will start out restricted to invitation only (in terms of adding to the database), I hope to release a public key so anyone willing can contribute to the testing. However, everyone is able to view the results of the the cardfights. Given some database experience you can send specific queries by Python integration to get detailed information on whatever it is you are looking for.

Since most of the population do not deal with databases every once in a blue moon I'll post neat graphs that display expected and unexpected trends in the decks tested. All of this is backed by a secure server and frequent backups and more importantly, people who volunteer their time into improving the vanguard community. 

### 3. Reader Input
