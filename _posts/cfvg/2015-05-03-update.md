Topics are presented in a very sporadic manner. I suggest using RSS feeds (or the mailing list I'm trying to set up) in order to keep up to date. In terms of how "updated" I am about the scene I would say a whole lot. Even though I lack articles on Legion or Stride or the next booster set I do a fair bit of research on everything. My blog tends to look more into the foundations rather then the next big thing so it often seems like I'm behind but rest assured. If you have anything you want to specifically point out then I'll provide a preliminary answer as fast as possible. Articles take a lot of time to write, cross-reference, and articulate. That said, my list for future projects include:

- Early game optimization
- Attacking with a locked/locked-down field
- Determinate dominating decks
