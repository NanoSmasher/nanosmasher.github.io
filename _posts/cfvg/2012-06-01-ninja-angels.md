#### Woah there! This is a REALLY outdated post. For more current and accurate articles visit my [main page](/cfvg).

<p>I had this sudden notion, and I thought it would be awesome!<br />
So Ergodiel&#8217;s effect usually work to about 0-1 times a game. Not that good. But what if they had nothing to guard with?<br />
Void master is a great (IMBA) card, but its counterblast can be hefty in some decks. but what if there effects can be used more?<br />
Putting them together is perfect: AF can unflip but unlike Nova&#8217;s they can hold the grade 3&#8217;s and there is a purpose for hitting with your vanguard, plus they aren&#8217;t CounterBlast heavy. NB deplete hand advantage and provide pressure as Reaguard to allow the Vanguard&#8217;s attack to hit.<br />
<span style="color:#0000ff;">Basic idea</span> : Force the opponent to drop cards with your Nubatamas and then heal by attacking with your vanguard. Use criticals to inflict more damage with your vanguard and stands to remove rearguards and more hand disadvantage.</p><!-- more -->

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<div><em>Cosmo Healer, Ergodiel</em> &#8211; Heal damage. Make sure you have a Cosmo or else it&#8217;s not that dangerous<br />
<em>Stealth Dragon, Voidmaster</em> &#8211; self-explanatory, can hit rearguards to pull off effects as well. If it stands, you can either try to hit a rearguard and deplete attacks, or hit thier vanguard and pull one more card out of them (although with trigger it&#8217;s 14k)<br />
<em>Fate Healer Ergodiel</em> &#8211; For the chain. 9k with 7k boosters lets it hit for 16k<br />
<em>Love Machine Gun, Nociel</em> &#8211; Switching and unflipping. As it is 8k and it&#8217;s effect only works when called, intercept ASAP<br />
<em>Stealth Beast, Chigasumi</em> &#8211; For Dreadmaster, but can also be useful when you are winning severly in hand advantage<br />
<em>Heavenly Injector</em> &#8211; For the chain. Being one of the two 7k boosters lets you consistently hit for 16k.<br />
<em>Battle Cupid, Nociel</em> &#8211; Switching and unflipping. Do not boost with it.<br />
<em>Pure Keeper, Requiel</em> &#8211; I only put two since almost a quarter of my cards are Nubatama&#8217;s, and it needs to drop an AF to protect an AF. This card helps hands in the middle game when there are 2~4 cards.<br />
<em>Stealth Dragon, Dreadmaster</em> &#8211; Getting more discarding with the Nubatama&#8217;s. If it is boosting the grade 2, better to hit a Rearguard.<br />
<em>Miracle Feather Nurse</em> &#8211; Ride chain. Your safe if the Grade 1 rides on top but thier may have trouble if you don&#8217;t.<br />
<em>Sunny Smile Angel</em> &#8211; No questions asked<br />
<em>Happy Bell, Nociel</em> &#8211; For crucial unflipping, otherwise don&#8217;t use it<br />
<em>Aurora Ribbon Pidgeon</em> &#8211; More stands to deplete hand advantage and possibly attack with voidmaster again to hit with it&#8217;s effect<br />
<em>Critical Hit Angel</em> &#8211; Punish them for not being able to guard your Vanguard<br />
<em>Rocket Dash Unicorn</em> &#8211; Cause you can&#8217;t punish them enough</div>
<h2><strong></strong> <strong>Stragety</strong></h2>
<p>I would say to put a Chigasumi and Dreadmaster early in the game, and Voidmaster after you guarded heavily for a turn. Other then that, I don&#8217;t have much to say.</p>

<h2><strong>Advantages</strong></h2>
<p>They have much more pressure then a normal AF deck and healing at least one damage is quite easy. All the cards work well together and there isn&#8217;t any situation where you won&#8217;t be hitting for magic numbers. Guarding is easy with this deck becuase you will want to overguard: then you will have less cards then your opponent when you start your turn. But if you have a large hand, better off not using those NB and just swing at the VG.</td>
<td>
<h2><strong>Diadvantages</strong></h2>
<p>The key disadvantage of this deck is the ride chain. If you can&#8217;t ride up, it will hurt you. The Grade 1 line up is slightly packed. I can&#8217;t have the max perfect guards because of the NB. I&#8217;m not certain about the amount of unflipping, but I believe it&#8217;s enough. Make sure you can use the counterblasts every turn. It is a very technical deck requiring careful hand, field and damage management to be sucessful.</td>
