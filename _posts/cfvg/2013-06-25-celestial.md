#### Woah there! This is a REALLY outdated post. For more current and accurate articles visit my [main page](/cfvg).

<p>A tight-knit group of angels deliver judgement to all the poor disciples living under it. Celestials are a devastating bunch, being able to overwhelm any deck in three turns max. Zerachiel accompanies this group to bring forth the shower of doom.</p>
<p><strong>Idea</strong><br /> 26|26|26</p>
<p><strong>General Advantages</strong><br /> Extremely powerful columns makes it hard for any deck to guard for more than three turns. It&#8217;s better than Shamsiel&#8217;s 21|21|21 and Metatron&#8217;s 21|21|26. It also includes an 11k vanguard.</p><!-- more -->
<p><strong>General Disadvantages</strong><br /> Defense is a slight problem despite the 11k base. Both Shamsiel and Metatron has highly abusive abilities that make Angel Feather unique and interesting, but Zerachiel is a very linear skill that does not require much thought.</p>
<p><strong>Latest Improvement:</strong> BT11</p>
<h2>BT11</h2>
<p><strong>Pseudonym:</strong> Heaven&#8217;s Everlasting Cannon<br /> <strong>Notable Pros:</strong> N/A<br /> <strong>Notable Cons:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Grade 3 (8)</strong><br /> 4 Solidfy Celestial, Zerachiel<br /> 4 Booting Celestial, Sandalphon<br /> <strong>Grade 2 (11)</strong><br /> 4 Candle Celestial, Sariel<br /> 4 Wildshot Celestial, Raquel<br /> 3 Essence Celestial, Becca<br /> <strong>Grade 1 (14)</strong><br /> 4 Adamantine Celestial, Aniel<br /> 4 Underlay Celestial, Hesediel<br /> 4 Marking Celestial, Arabaki<br /> 2 Order Celestial, Yeqon<br /> <strong>Grade 0 (17)</strong><br /> 1 First Aid Celestial, Penuel [FV]<br /> 4 Healing Celestial, Ramiel [HEAL]<br /> 4 Critical Hit Angel [CRIT]<br /> 4 Punishment Celestial, Shamihaza [CRIT]<br /> 4 Rampage Cart Angel [CRIT]</p>
<p><strong>Breakdown</strong><br /> <em>Booting Celestial, Sandalphon</em> WHAT? Sandalphon is absolutely crucial, even more so then Remiel. You&#8217;ll see why in the strategy section.<br /> <em>Candle Celestial, Sariel</em> Primary focus is to activate Zerachiel&#8217;s LB. Almost certain to get one when you need it.<br /> <em>Essence Celestial, Becca</em> Just a vanilla but it has the archetype status.<br /> <em>Order Celestial, Yeqon</em> Another &#8220;Just because it&#8217;s an archetype&#8221; card.<br /> <em>Rampage Cart Angel</em> This and Critical Hit so we can carry out the maximum death sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong><br /> Ride Zerachiel. Use Sariel to put a second copy of Zerchiel into the Damage Zone. If Sariel is damaged then pull it out with Penuel.</p>
<p>To reach 26k, all columns must be at least 20k before limit break. With Underlay, all the Grade 3&#8217;s + Wildshot can do so.<br /> But what if you don&#8217;t have Underlay? I mean, what is the likelihood of getting a complete back row of Underlays by Limit Break? (Hint: it&#8217;s close to 8%). So resort to plan B.</p>
<p><strong>Columns</strong><br /> To make 20k, so LB makes 26k<br /> Hesediel &gt; Zerachiel/Raquel</p>
<p>We already have one unit we are dependent on (Zerachiel), so we really don&#8217;t want to rely on another unit (Hesediel). That&#8217;s why we have plan B.</p>
<p>Arabaki/Yeqon &gt; Sandalphon</p>
<p>Remember that a Hesediel&gt;Sandalphon is possible, though very wasteful.</p>
<p><strong>Variations</strong><br /> Nociel? Armaros? Okay, just try to understand this.<br /> They don&#8217;t work well.</p>
<p>Consider a Shamsiel deck:<br /> Nociel is great because it increases the power of Shamsiel (defense on opponent&#8217;s turn).<br /> Armaros is great because Shamsiel unflips every turn, possibly making the cost zero.</p>
<p>Can Zerachiel get +2k defense from Nociel? Can Zerachiel unflip? No. You are adding random units that TRY to use resources more efficiently, but there is no synergy between the Celestials and it. Worse, since both units aren&#8217;t Celestials, they DO NOT gain power on Limit Break, so your wonderful 16k column is brought up to 19k instead of 22k. Sure, units can be replaced, but then why did it need replacing in the first place?</p>
<p>Remiel? Eww no. You want to get ride a vital back-up option for a really bad break-ride?</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>One last thing to discuss is whether or not 26k rows is actually worth it. Well, without Sandalphon a 26|26|26 is still POSSIBLE, just not probable. More likely, it&#8217;ll be around 21|21|26. So compare lets compare the least amount of non-PG cards needed to stop:</p>
<p>16|16/21|16: 4.65<br /> 16|16/21|21: 5.55<br /> 21|16/21|21:  6.1<br /> 21|21|26: 6.55<br /> 26|26/31|26: 7.65<br /> *slash means is could be either power with no effect on the amount of cards used.</p>
<p>God have mercy if the opponent is facing a 26|26|26. I honestly can not see many fights where a player can last more than three consecutive turns before being overwhelmed (Remove 7.65 for their hand, when they only gain 3 cards a turn, you can deplete someone with 14 cards in hand when you hit limit break). You&#8217;ll need about 68,250 worth of shield to guard everything every turn, way more pressuring then Shamsiel&#8217;s 53,250.<i class="fa fa-stop"></i></p>
