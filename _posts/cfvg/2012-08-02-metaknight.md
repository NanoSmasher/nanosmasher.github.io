#### Woah there! This is a REALLY outdated post. For more current and accurate articles visit my [main page](/cfvg).

<p>Royal Paladins started off with and stay with the tried and true concept of raw power even amidst the new sets. Well, this is where it all began. From the (Original) King of Kings himself, here comes the free masons.</p>
<p>NOTE: This deck is used by Fighter Gotou Kiyomi/後藤聖弥.(National Champion) Read more about him in this <a href="http://vanguardus.blogspot.ca/2012/07/spotlight-gotou-kiyomi.html">Fighter&#8217;s Spotlight</a>.<br />
<strong><br />
Idea</strong><br />
Using Royal Paladin&#8217;s tried and true powerhouse technique to make high-powered columns.</p>
<p><strong>General Advantages</strong><br />
Alfred grants one of anything.</p><!-- more -->
<p><strong>General Disadvantages</strong><br />
10k vanguard combined with Set 1 cards. Really not too spectacular</p>
<p><strong>Latest Improvement:</strong> Booster Set 5</p>

<p><strong>Breakdown</strong><br />
<em>King of Knights, Alfred</em> Our leader. Helps bring out vanilla but it should be rarely used.<br />
<em>Knight of Conviction, Bors</em> A great Rearguard to hit 20 on every line. At least until Palamedes kicks him out forever.<br />
<em>Blaster Blade</em> What RP deck would be complete without four?<br />
<em>Knight of Silence, Gallatin</em> Staple Vanilla<br />
<em>Covenant Knight, Randolf</em> A terrible card, but it is the only option we have. If you really despise it, you can tech in a GR2 vanilla from another clan&#8230;<br />
<em>Little Sage Marron</em> Staple and allows our Bors to hit 21k lines<br />
<em>Flash Shield, Isuelt</em> Staple<br />
<em>Lake Maiden, Lien</em> 7000 for the other option for Bors. Also, it removes our rubbish Randolf, Wingal and Govannon<br />
<em>Wingal</em> For the lolz. Seriously, don&#8217;t bring this out.<br />
<em>Barcgal</em> Banned, but Stardust is NOT going here just yet.<br />
<em>Yggrasil Maiden, Elaine</em> The Heal that saved Aichi&#8217;s doom about 4 or more times.<br />
<em>Flogal</em> Bait.<br />
<em>Bringer of Good Luck, Epona</em> Critical trigger<br />
<em>Knight of the Future, Llew</em> A second set to get the opponent to guard, and then we pump it to our high-powered rearguard.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong><br />
Do the Aichi. No need to explain much.</p>
<p><strong>Columns</strong><br />
The only thing to NOT put behind a vanguard Alfred is Marron. That is stupid. Barcgal works very well, although in most cases you have Superior ridden BB. Wingal is a meh option, as it&#8217;s not doing much anyways. The most reasonable unit to put behind however would be Lien, as you can use its effect and still swing at full power.</p>
<p>Bors and Marron, or Bors and Lien.</p>
<p>Wingal and BB isn&#8217;t going to do anything. Keep that Wingal for shield, or discarding.</p>
<p><strong>Variations</strong><br />
With a Barkgal ban, all seems lost. But here&#8217;s a fun little diddy you can try. First, replace Barcgal for Stardust in the first vanguard. Replace all copies of Wingal, a Randolf and a Bors with 4 Barkgal. Doing the math, 1/2 games you&#8217;ll call out Barkgal. Even if you don&#8217;t, keep the center booster empty and ride Alfred. Counterblast and call out Barkgal, and in turn pull out Flogal. That&#8217;s a free +2, and now combine that Flogal with Randolf and swing correctly at 13k and 16k. The remaining Barkgals is for shield, Wingal/Randolf shield is now Lien&#8217;s shield(no longer needed behind Alfred) and you went right through a loophole.<br />

<h2><strong>BT05</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Pseudonym:</strong> Ancient Power<br />
<strong>Notable Pros:</strong> Palamedes<br />
<strong>Notable Cons:</strong> N/A</p>
<p><strong>Grade 3 (8)</strong><br />
  4  King of Knights, Alfred<br />

<strong>Grade 2 (11)</strong><br />

<strong>Grade 0 (17)</strong><br />
  1  Wingal Brave  [FV]<br />
  4  Yggdrasil Maiden, Elaine [HEAL]<br />
  4  Knight of the Future, Llew  [CRIT]<br />
  4  Bringer of Good Luck, Epona [CRIT]<br />
  4  <span style="color:#ff0000;">Alabaster Owl</span>  [CRIT]</p>
<p><strong>Breakdown</strong><br />
<em>Swordsman of The Explosive Flames, Palamedes</em> Able to hit 13k (the crossride #) alone, Able to hit 18k with anything boosting it, and hits to 22k at its peak.<br />
<em>Lamorak</em> This is just a vanilla.<br />
<em>Akane</em> is the Toypugal caller, allowing good lines to be built.<br />
<em>Toypugal</em> is RP&#8217;s 9k booster, and is our secret for everlasting power. Combining Marron we have full lines of 18k for every attack.<br />
<em>Alabaster Owl</em> No more need for Llew, as we lost Barkgal.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong><br />
The strategy is to keep making 18k+ columns. Akane&#8217;s and Alfred&#8217;s Counter Blast is to bring out Toypugal and Gallatin, therefore BB&#8217;s ability is less useful. You might need to use against the opponent&#8217;s pressure units, but in most part you shouldn&#8217;t worry.</p>
<p><strong>Columns</strong><br />
Palamedes + Anything(Marron prefered)</p>
<p>Considering nearly all your attackers are 9k and over, and all the good boosters are 8k and over, almost anything goes.</p>
<p><strong>Variations</strong><br />
Blaster Blade, Gallatin, Akane and Lamoark can be shuffled around as you see fit. All we need now to complete our deck is to wait for Wingal Brave, so we have a moving starter.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>This deck is Set 1 amped. Don&#8217;t expect anything to amazing to happen, except for double crits. On that note, it is worth mentioning that this deck is not aggresive even with 12 crits. It applys constant pressure to the opponent and it is that wears them down. While many clans have vanguards with high power vanguards(Set 5 brought multiple +10k abilities), Alfred only needs to go for 18000. He can function perfectly well without a unit behind him, expanding more options and making it to make complete sidelines.<i class="fa fa-stop"></i></p>
