#### Woah there! This is a REALLY outdated post. For more current and accurate articles visit my [main page](/cfvg).

Want to play tachikazes but can’t wait for it to be completed in Set 3?
Well, these dinodragons can’t wait either to break into tournaments preamaturely.
Though it doesn’t matter what base to use, I chose Kagero’s because of their nation and looks, funny as they don’t suit to each other’s Winning Image.
So here is the Pre-Jurrasic Tachikaze deck.

Basic idea: Sharply increase guard in the Early game to survive right to the end. Use the vanguard to sharply drain your opponent’s resources.

###Deck Recipe

**Grade 3 (8)**

4 x Tyrant DeathRex
4 x Chaos Dragon, DinoChaos

**Grade 2 (10)**

4 x Assault Dragon, Blightops
4 x Dragon Knight, Nehalem
2 x Cannon Fire Dragon, CannonGear

**Grade 1 (12)**

4 x Winged Dragon, Skyptero
4 x Sonic Noah
4 x Flame of Hope, Aermo

**Grade 0 (20)**

1 x Dragon Egg   [Starting]
3 x Ironclad Dragon, Shieldon
4 x Dragon Monk, Genjo  [HEAL]
4 x Dragon Dancer, Monica [DRAW]
2 x Gattling Claw Dragon [DRAW]
2 x Demonic Dragon Mage Rakshasa [CRITICAL]
4 x Embodiment of the Spear, Tahr [CRITICAL]

###Requirement

TD02: Most of the Kageros
BT01: Shieldon(C), Sonic Noah(C), Blightops(R), Tyrant Deathrex(R)
– Tahr (R)
BT02: Dragon Egg(R), Syptero(R), CannonFire(C), Dinochaos(C)
– Gattling (R)

###Cost

The Kagero Trial deck runs at $20, and each (R) Tachikaze is only a dollar and every (C) is 0.25. As explained in my mods you can forgo the extra Tahr and Gattling and instead take the normal set delivered by the Trial deck.
The tachikaze alone will be $13 and many people can throw free Kageros at you. And most people don’t care about Tachikaze they might even part with that for free. Don’t buy them in packs, singles are much easier. The upgraded Set 3’s Jurrasics are just about the same as this plus Perfect guards.

###Description

 * _Tyrant DeathRex_ – The Main Vanguard. Retire Blightops first if you hit, and the Skyptero behind him after you run out of Shieldons. No Limit Break! That means your opponent can’t stop it AND you start pressure in the MidGame, not the End Game like other Limit Breakers.
 * _Chaos Dragon, DinoChaos_ – Our backup GR3 in case we miss DeathRex. Technically, you can also use a Kagero, but then you can’t use the returning abilities as they require a Tachikaze Vanguard. I don’t recommend using its Superior ride because you waste precious resources early on. For riding it as a cost of CB2, that means you have to take further damage in order to save other Tachikazes, and the extra card you drive checked is minused when you bring out DeathRex. But, you might be itching to use the easiest Superior Ride ever so go ahead if you feel like matching up to another’s superior ride and don’t feel like riding Tyrant anytime soon.
 * _Assualt Dragon, Blightops_ – A great card as it upgrades from 5000 \S/ to 10000 \S/ with Shieldon, thinning the deck, and makes people wary of hitting this Rearguard. (I stopped my friend from Vermillioning everything because of that.) That means if the opponent does not attack it, it is a good intercepter.
 * _Dragon Knight, Nehalem_ – Another card to hopefully net us triggers that doesn’t misfire. it can also void out an early damage if your opponent wants to negate your triggers.
 * _Cannon Fire Dragon, CannonGear_ – Mwahahaha! This card is the only 11k Grade 2 without Restraint! Wonderful! But take care in using it, most likely one a game is enough. I didn’t put 4 since we need Nehalem here to net us triggers.
 * _Winged Dragon, Skyptero_ – The Grade one that would be put behind Tyrant. Although you only need one a game, we put four because you MUST have one by the time Tyrant comes around.
 * _Sonic Noah_ – Vanilla. Boost Blightops with this. If your running low on boosters for Blightops frequently you can go add more Bahrs.
 * _Flame of Hope, Aermo_ – The ability is quite nice, not clan restricted and help us out of drawing Blightops and others past its time. You’ll also be likely to keep it there for the game, so it’s a good to go.
 * _Dragon Egg_ – Treat it like a CounterBlast one, get 10000 Shield. That’s pretty sweet because you always have it and its a safeguard for retire effects until we get Skyptero.
 * _Dragon Monk, Genjo_ – Heal
 * _Dragon Dancer, Monica_ – Draw, put more of this card for it’s power.
 * _Gattling Claw Dragon_ – Draw Triggers for more of those 5k shields, since we have plenty of 10k Shields. Also it can help with the empty Perfect Guard area.
 * _Demonic Dragon Mage Rakshasa_ – Crit. Less of this cause of the power.
 * _Embodiment of the Spear Tahr_ – Another Crit so they want to guard our attacks.
 * _Ironclad Dragon, Shieldon_ – See blightops. Can also be a 6k booster, if you really need that.

###Strategy

Ride Sonic Noah. Call an Aermo to a sideline Rearguard ASAP so Triggers start working. Next up is Nehalem, with Cannon Gear to bring Dragon Egg back. If you don’t have a Grade 3 at this time, maybe Cannon Gear can be used since it’s 11k can hold the attacks down. Only bring out one Blightops at a time and put it behind a Noah; if you know they don’t have a 11k Vanguard it also helps to bring this behind an Aermo.

Advantages|Diadvantages
The largest advantage will be Dragon Egg himself. It is the poor little engine of the entire deck and without it we succumb to nothing. It has amazing shield that will keep you alive through the middle game (and is the only starter you want to return to your hand.). Tachikaze have low counterblast costs and therefore does not need much damage to use their skills (Tyrant doesn’t need a Limit Break!). Also, they have great field presence and hand advantage, always striking the 15k-16k mark as Rearguard and 21k as Vanguard.|The are only two disadvantages in this deck: The largest one is it’s low synergy with its Kagero base, though that can’t be helped. If you get the upgraded (Jurrasic) version, then this problem removes itself. However, there are no Perfect guards in this deck because of the lazy synergy making it bad in that case. Tachikaze decks are also predictable but its because they lack a cardpool. They can’t go into 21k without triggers, but it’s supplemented by consistent 15k~16k attacks and higher defenses. Right now they are solid and there is no real disadvantage to using Tachikaze, other then the terrible synergy with Kageros.

###Modifications

To make it cheap just take out the Tahr’s and Gattlings and bring back in the Stands. I put Aermo in because I wanted more trigger phasing abilities (especailly after shuffling to add Shieldon), and having 15k attacks is okay. However, if the entire meta you play in tourneys are 11k and up Vanguards I suggest removing them for Bahr, that way you can push for both early damage AND consistent 18k> marks. You can also tech in a Bors-clone while your at it, and it makes for a nice gleaming target.

###Final Words

Tachikaze are powerful, but not diverse enough and are pretty boring. They do everything right, but have no real push like Ezel or Vermillion. And without the option of perfect guards until set 3 they need to push FAST because those extra 10k shields will empty out eventually.
