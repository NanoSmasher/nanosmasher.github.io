<p>I give up. I&#8217;m going to start using Alice&#8217;s <a href="http://www.v-mundi.com/2012/shielding-stages/">stages notation</a>.</p>
<p>Since cards guard in intervals of 5000 a stage is equivalent to that amount.<br />
A 1 stage attack is guarded for 5000, a 2 stage attack for 10000 and so on.</p>
<p>A 2/2/2 means the entire field is hitting 2 stages.</p>
<p>I probably won&#8217;t update old articles to match this, so you will still see 18|18|21 sometimes. So | means power of column in thousands while a / means the number of stages it hits for.</p>
<p>Finally, stages are universal so it doesn&#8217;t matter what power the opponent&#8217;s vanguard is because a 2 stage attack will always require \10/ or a 2 stage guard. (Gonna have to start limiting the use of \/ as well). If the vanguard is 11k, the range for the 2 stage attack is (16-20) but a 13k will have the range of (18-22). Either way, a 2 stage attack is consistent everywhere.</p>
