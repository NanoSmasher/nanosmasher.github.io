#### Woah there! This is a REALLY outdated post. For more current and accurate articles visit my [main page](/cfvg).

<p>Here comes a very interesting take on Royal paladins. In one of the most bizzare Winning Image ever, we use an overwhemling amount of grade threes in which Morikawa can find just acceptable. To put those grade 3&#8217;s to good use, we turn to Bridgette&#8217;s special ability. Although not as interesting as other drive checkers, our Surperior ride of Blaster Blade nets us a confirmed ride that other decks are limited to.</p>
<p>NOTE: Obivously, this is a deck requires Barcgal. Therefore this deck cannot be used in tournaments.</p>
<p><strong>Idea:</strong> Abuse Barcal to Safely ride into grade 3, then get crazy power with Bridgette.</p>
<p><strong>General Advantages:</strong><br /> Out of the outrageousness comes forth 28k vanguards and neverending supply of attacks. Although much better against 10k decks, it can put down 11k and even 13k vanguards.</p><!-- more -->
<p><strong>General Disadvantages:</strong><br /> The sole reason you are able to stuff so many grade 3&#8217;s lies in Barcgal. If you superior or normal ride Blaster Blade, resign right there, as there is nothing you can do.</p>
<p>And just as you suspect from so many Grade 3&#8217;s, you have little defenses</p>

<h2><strong>BT01 &amp; TD01</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Pseudonym:</strong> Butterfly Technique<br /> <strong>Notable Pros:</strong> N/A<br /> <strong>Notable Cons:</strong> Not enough Grade 3&#8217;s. I&#8217;m kidding. But RP gets better grade 3&#8217;s are later.</p>
<p><strong>Grade 3 (17)</strong><br />    4  Crimson Butterfly, Bridgette<br />    4  King of Knights, Alfred<br />    4  Demon Slaying Knight, Lohengrin<br />    4  Solitary Knight, Gancelot<br />    1  Knight of Conviction, Bors<br /> <strong>Grade 2 (4)</strong><br />    4  Blaster Blade<br /> <strong>Grade 1 (12)</strong><br />    4  Little Sage Marron<br />    4  Flash Shield, Isuelt<br />    4  Lake Maiden, Lien<br /> <strong>Grade 0 (17)</strong><br />    1 Barcgal   [FV]<br />    4  Yggrasil Maiden, Elaine [HEAL]<br />    2  Flogal   [STAND]<br />    2  Weapons Dealer, Govannon [DRAW]<br />    4  Bringer of Good Luck, Epona [CRIT]<br />    4  Knight of the Future, Llew  [CRIT]</p>
<p><strong>Breakdown</strong><br /> <em>Crimson Butterfly, Bridgette </em>I&#8217;m not putting 17 garde 3&#8217;s without a reason. This guy let&#8217;s us hit to 28k.<br /> <em>King of Knights, Alfred </em>Counterblasts can be used to bring out attackers.<br /> <em>Demon Slaying Knight, Lohengrin </em>Interesting option so we don&#8217;t get too predictable.<br /> <em>Solitary Knight, Gancelot </em>What&#8217;s better then 7 Grade 3&#8217;s? Returning Grade 3&#8217;s!<br /> <em>Knight of Conviction, Bors </em>More Grade 3&#8217;s I say. More Grade 3&#8217;s!<br /> <em>Blaster Blade </em>Let&#8217;s Gancelot do something while being epic with retiring.<br /> <em>Little Sage Marron </em>Staple<br /> <em>Flash Shield, Isuelt Staple.</em> Don&#8217;t think about using this deck if you don&#8217;t have 4.<br /> <em>Lake Maiden, Lien </em>I don&#8217;t know, but it is 7k with a general effect.<br /> <em>Barcgal </em>The unit to make magic happen<br /> <em>Yggrasil Maiden, Elaine </em>Heal trigger<br /> <em>Flogal </em>The targeted pink doggy<br /> <em>Weapons Dealer, Govannon </em>Draw so we have a smudge of a chance to guard<em>.</em><br /> <em>Bringer of Good Luck, Epona </em>Make them guard as well.<br /> <em>Knight of the Future, Llew </em>Because we can use Barcgal</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong><br /> There are two ways to go about this when you ride the grade 3. You can start with Lohengrin and soulcharge, or start right with Bridgette. You are hoping to get Alfred for a free call so you don&#8217;t waste anything. As well, Blaster Blade can push some units away since you are giong all out on the vanguard.</p>
<p>For an alternative to Alfreds/BB&#8217;s Counterblast, you can try Lohengrin&#8217;s counterblast.  After a while, start to re-ride Bridgettes. If you can last, you can build up 8 soul and at that point, Lohengrin can clean the field(Attack Rearguard to Rearguard). Manage that, and guarding becomes much easier. With the consistent power of Bridgette,victory should come quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Variations</strong><br /> If you feel really daring, you can remove about 2 Grade 1&#8217;s and BB to add 3 more Bors.</p>
<p>As well, you can remove flogal or Govannon for Llew</p>
<h2><strong>BT03</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>
<p>Bors can now be replaced with Palamedes. After Bridgette you can put anything that isn&#8217;t Galahad, and some favourites are Gigantic Charger(For free calls) and Soul Saver Dragon(to use the soul). Even Pendragon can be teched for fun (and if you DON&#8217;T get a grade 3 by its skill, then you better feel sad.)</p>
<p>Now for more crits, add in Alabaster Owl.</p>
<h2><strong>BT10</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Variations</strong></p>
<p>Bors can now be replaced with Palamedes. After Bridgette you can put anything that isn&#8217;t Galahad, and some favourites are Gigantic Charger(For free calls) and Soul Saver Dragon(to use the soul). Even Pendragon can be teched for fun (and if you DON&#8217;T get a grade 3 by its skill, then you better feel sad.)</p>
<p>Note for more crits, add in Alabaster Owl.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Being the cheapest RP deck you can make, you can remove Alfred, Palamedes, Soul Saver and acouple of Llews to save lots of money. If you pick out a grade 3 line like (4 Bridgette, 4 Gigantic, 4 Bors, 4 Lohengrin), and try to pick out free Bridgettes and the like, it can run down to $100 dollars or less.</p>
<p>Now, if you count up all your triggers and Grade 3&#8217;s, you&#8217;ll find Brigdette gets 33/50, or two thirds of the deck is a power-up. Doing slight calculations, you go from a normal 12% for double triggers to 53%!</p>
<p>With Gancelot returning adding more BB&#8217;s and Alfred bringing out non-GR3&#8217;s, you should feel confident of going to 28k for every attack.<i class="fa fa-stop"></i></p>
