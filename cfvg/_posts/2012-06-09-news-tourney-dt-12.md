The following table contains the Champion decks for the District tournament 2012

NOTE: This is an analysis for the Japanese Format. Although my article deals with cards only found in the English Format, it is nonetheless important to realize Japan’s meta.

Now, Japan has gotten their EB03 a little early, but that’s okay. It shows us how the game will stack up when it reaches us. So, How does the deck recipes stack up?

The End (Kagero): 16
Blaster (Shadow Paladin + Royal Paladin): 12
Ezel (Gold paladin): 4
Phantom (Shadow Paladin): 3
Tsukyomi (Oracle Think Tank): 2
Emperor (Spike brothers): 2
Vermillion (Narukami): 1
Specktral Duke Dragon (Gold paladin): 1
Asure Dragon (Nova Grappler): 1
Neonectar: 1
Total: 42

Okay, so Those 13k decks still run a lot of the party(three quarter in fact)

Those Lord blaster decks are more similar to one another now but still varied among themselves. One even put in a Pendragon(haha!). Most of the DOTE Decks are mirrors of each other and still the top tiered deck. An interesting idea is one of the Phantom Blaster Overlord Decks incorporated 3 DOTE tech. Tsukyomi decks are also up in that alley, and I don’t think any of these decks will be knocked off for a long time. So how was The new Limit Break cards? Did they meet there expectation as overpowered units you before had thought?

What? A Neonectar deck? How did it survive the rampage of the Fire Empire? Excluding the Gold Paladins, Narukami and other new clans just can’t match up to the meta game quite yet. Narukami is nothing as these tournaments prove. Although they were in standing, none of them when to the finals of that region. Asura couldn’t land enough hits. Every deck here (Excluding the Neonectars) had 3~4 null guards. 3 in 13k decks. This shows the importance of [perfect defenses in the meta as a staple](/cfvg/lesson2). The Ezel line and Spectral Duke has done a number on a few of the decks and it is only the presence of null guards that kept them from getting any more wins. Spike Brothers actually have a spot now in the Tournament. Consistency and power has been achieved by the new cards from the Extra Booster. If any clan had gotten a boost by EB03, it would be Spike brothers.<i class="fa fa-stop"></i>
