#### Woah there! This is an archived article talking pre Set-5. If you want to look at more current stuff visit my [main page](/cfvg).

![Quick Overview](/cfvg/image/quick-palemoon.png)

**Playstyle:**

The Pale Moon clan is a circus that handles assasinations with an assortment of sneaky tricks up its sleeve. ONLY including set 3, this clan is the WORST completed clan you can make. Ouch, that was harsh, but it the true reality. The largest problem comes from its unique mechanic – get effects based off of specific cards in your soul. Nothing wrong there, but what makes is bad is that there is no reliable way to put those specific cards into your soul. The only way you can add cards to your soul is by soulcharging; and by the looks of chance that can pretty well means you soul charge as mad as a Dark Irregular Amon until you get that card. Then you stop. Wow, that means you are playing with two different strageties instead of one, and you can’t control when to change it or which one you want to start with. Well that’s really wonderful since everyone wants to make this game into a game of lucksacking. (Note sarcasm) I will name the first area, soulcharging madly as ACT I and the actual fighting and benefitting as ACT II. <!-- more --> The key card, luckly it’s only one, is Crimson Beast Tamer. Don’t have 4 or these RR? Don’t even try to think about putting it off with one less. If Crimson beast Tamer is the key card, that means I’ll repeat it many times. I’ll shorten it to CBT. In the best case is when you get to ride one all your problems are solved. But what if you don’t get it? Soulcharge 20, that’s what. At it’s best, it’s about equal to Royal Paladins (really, it’s still worse). Normally it is much less viable then other clans. Even Great Nature can pwn. Available and Future cards: Extra booster 1 is migatatable: Although powerful cards are found here(Golden Beast Tamer) all of them are situational at best. I’ll talk more about them when EB01EN or BT07 is released. But don’t turn away yet. Don’t throw these cards into a fire and think you’ll get more use out of them. Set 7 welcomes much needed units that can(read: will) boost their game DRASTICALLY. Number one is a card that can add a specific card from your deck to your soul. What? A card that adds any card (*cough*CrimsonBeastTamer*cough*) into the soul? Wow! Why haven’t they done that already? Card’s that swap the soul and the field? Time for some OP comboes! And what’s more? Stand Triggers that we so desperately need? And powerful pressuring Grade 3’s? Limit Break Unit?! Guarding from Soul? Gets you giddy thinking about it huh?

|Advantages	|Disadvantages|
|---|---|
|Both Rearguard and Vanguard create pressure|Extends to the limits of chance, thereby unreliable and inconsistent|
|Great against 10k VG decks|Bad hand management|
||Poor trigger set: No Stand triggers to make use of pressure game
||Poor trigger set: No Stand triggers to make use of pressure game
||Unecessarily large minus of unuseable soul
||High possibility of a deckout, by Soulcharging and drawing too many cards.
||Lack of power, or otherwise speed
||Slightly poor against 11k VG decks
||Heavy loss of advantage hard to recover. (Lose a lot in your hand and damage in the Opening Game)
||Hard reset of field has a high chance of death.
||Expensive? (Note that PM might be cheaper in English due to ‘better’ cards and the release of Set 6/7 before 3)
||Lack of card types make this deck perdicatble (And this deck trys to be unperdicatable)
||I could list a bit a few more, but you get the idea.

Deck|Hand|Drop
---|---|---
Dark Irregulars can deck themselves out due to soul charging a lot (And that is an understatement). Oracle Think Tanks can deck out by drawing too much. Pale Moon critcally drains thier deck by soulcharging and drawing. You want to know what’s wonderful? They need to do that even more so then OTT’s and DI if thier in ACT I. Like, a 40k Amon is okay but slightly unecessary, but since you need a specific card all that waste just builds…|With draw triggers and a stable field your hand is better then most. However you need to spend time to block attacks against your Rearguards as well as calling out multiple units in the Opening. Your hand will be at it’s peak in the middle game as those draw triggers redeem what you lost, so take advantage of that and don`t get pushed into the late game too fast.|Nothing useful here.
**Field**|**Damage**|**Soul**
ACT I can kill you if you spam soulcharges, because ACT II comes along and now you have to plop down more units to get a good field. Make careful note to what you should bring out. One hard reset (like Kagero or Dragonic Kaiser Vermillion) can ruin your game. But the field is quite stable for most of the game.|You need to take damage early in the game in order to use effects. But be careful about how much you actually need. Although all Counterblasts are one you still need to manage it to apply constant pressure.|A large amount of your soul is useless. You only need about 3 different cards in your soul and nothing else. That soul will then become a big minus.

*<center>Pale Moon is a White, Middle game deck</center>*

Opening|Middle game|End game
---|---|---
Your field will suck in the beginning calling random units in hopes to soulcharge a CBT if you ride Skull Juggle instead of CBT. But make note to where you call it, as they might stay for the entire game if your not careful.|This is where you need to have CBT by now, and apply multiple attacks to quickly send your opponent into the End game and finish them off before you get into the End Game.|If you still have Alice and company your in good shape. Otherwise, there isn’t much to push onwards for, except your triggers alone. This is sometimes where a Robert VG is better then another VG.

---|---
**Pressure**|**Resistance**
You have great pressure with Alice and bunny, not so much with mirror demon but still useful. Your vanguard (Robert) is great at bluffing and stacking. The manticore is a 13k hitter. Plus, the soul is like a haven, meaning they can’t put pressure on that.|You are kind of bad in the Early game, so make sure not to kill yourself to fast. After though, you will build up a pretty big hand. Remember that the opponent likes to target your Rearguards, so it also helps conserve your attack power.

###Grade 0

**Controller of Hades [Starter]** – Our Forced starter. And we have a minus becuase unless we SC CBT that card will leave the deck forever. – Thank god for the new PM starter for set 7.

**Rainbow Magician [DRAW]** – Another SCer, but this time we will be using the effect much more frequently in ACT I and rarely in ACT II.

**Spiral Master [DRAW]** – Another draw trigger to propel us into the late game, some would say that is too much. Nonetheless, it’s these two draw triggers along with a stable field setup that makes up the beautiful hand management. – Better to replace with a Stand Trigger later

**Dynamite Juggler [CRITICAL]** – Because these are the only triggers we can run.

**Funny pierrot [HEAL]** – Staple

###Grade 1

**Hades hypnotist** – Your staple perfect guard

**Skull Juggler** – A reliable soulcharger to hope to get CBT in.

**Midnight Bunny** – Can’t put pressure without having this behind an Alice. Then, your opponent will target Alice. – Funny thing is, you can boost an unsuspecting grade 2, then when your opponent let’s the attack through pop out an Alice behind it.

**Turqiose Beast Tamer** – Hold off on calling it unless you are getting a CBt in your soul. – Riding it assures it goes into the soul and boosts Alice’s pressure game – The good thing is that once the condition is met it stays like that for the entire game. – Being 9k, that’s a good number for CBT and Manticore

**Darkmetal bicorn** – Funny thing is, there is no use in this staple. – That’s because there is no 8k Units you will use in a complete PM deck.

###Grade 2

**Crimson beast tamer** – No PM deck can be complete without it. Put 4 or else you die. – Good skill, becoming a 11k attacker – The good thing is that once the condition is met it stays like that for the entire game.

**Mirror Demon** – Chaining Alice with Mirror demon doesn’t really work, becuase Bunny is going to move in with alice, and so your attack will be pretty much 8k with a boost, but afterwards it’s going to be nothing brought out. – If you hope for CBT or Cerberus, then bring that out and don’t try another attack that most likely won’t hit. It will go for 21k+ instead of 15k and 11k(If your opponent actually let that through). – Just a hog of counter blasts and card space. – I personally don’t run it, but it can be used for the odd gimick (moreso when your opponent keeps your damage clean)

**Elephant Juggler** – This is our back-up if we don’t have CBT. As 9k it’s okay on attack as well.

**Hungry Clown** – Yes, better then Juggler as it SC constantly, but you can afford having this card NOT hit. You need to be SURE to get cards in the soul, like DI. – And after CBT is in the soul, there is nothing left in it’s abiliy like Juggler. – Besides, Juggler can charge about 3 before being ridden off.

**Barking Cerberus** – Vanilla

###Grade 3

**Nightmare Doll Alice** – Nightmare Doll Alice is the star of the show and works in almost all situations – It applies constant pressure because they know if it hits something worse is coming out. – Unlike Sky Diver, this is from your soul, so you lose nothing. – More like Thantanos, a beautiful pressure card. – Remember never to hit a rearguard with this. That will waste both Counter blasts and pressure. The damage resource is deadly precious, and pressure is against the vanguard. Force them to drop a 10k shield, instead of losing a 5k intercepter or whatnot. Other things can hit that. – Here’s a tricky combo that works if you only have two lanes of attack and Alice in the soul – – Attack hits, use Bunny to move in to call Alice. Use Alice to bring out bunny. – – vice versa works as well. Remember the effects aren’t simultaneous, so you can’t do it at the same time.

**Twilight Magician Robert** – People say this card sucks, and that’s because they look at it’s megablast effect – Word of warning: Never use Robert’s Megablast. Then you will see it’s real use. – Most Decks have units that can attack independantly. Plus, your VG is 10k, making it a terrible waste of a MegaBlast, which you can use for Alice in a much better way. – It soulcharges, a big help to getting CBT and others in the soul. – It also anticipates the top card of the deck. Like Amaterasu it’s not only looking for Triggers, it also looks for key cards (like CBT?) and then you can bring a card to soulcharge it. -Though, really, it’s going to get replaced once Set 7 comes out. It’s really for a backup, and that the other two GR3’s work remarkably better in RG. The anticipating is quite useful for VG pressure, to compile the RG pressure.

**Barking Manticore Cerberus** – The good thing is that once the condition is met it stays like that for the entire game. – It’s like a Palamedes, but to meet the condition is actually quite harder. – The problem is that, if you use it’s VG skill when you ride it, although it’s a good card it’s a minus one if you don’t have CBT. – There are only three ways to get CBT in your hand between your GR2 Juggler ride and your GR3. By Drive check, damaging a draw trigger, or just drawing it right that moment. That doesn’t give lots of wiggle room. – As VG, it’s not as good as RG. Robert is just less about luck and more chance. – However, I still recommend 1 since the power rating might just be what your looking for when you need that final push. Okay you got me. It’s more about Set 7 then Set 3. Nonetheless, I hope you had a dilightful view of the soon to be deadly circus.

###Decks Matchups

**Nova Grapplers** – Too much stand might ruin your field presence

**Tachikaze** – Actaully, pretty fun. Tachi aims your VG, and you aim for thiers. Both have good shield, but you have RG Pressure.

**Oracle Think Tank** – Too much shield means you might as well have vanilla units on the field.

**Royal Paladin** – If they use a MegaBlast and hope to kill off Alfred/SSD, they also kill thier pressure game, which is the only thing against RP. But RP has good field and power, just put a couple attacks aimed at thier RG. Kagero – It’s going to rape you over and over, since they retire everything AND anything they can’t retire they attack it for the entire turn, meanning it puts tremendous strain on your hand. They kinda don’t force your damage until you have nothing to CB for. Plus the 11k VG.

**Dark Irregular** – Both of you are defensive in the beginning (SC much), so your safe to get a CBT. Then obviously, your better off then most, plus you always have a Perfect Guard and draw power.

**Spike Brothers** – Try not to take too much damage early. It can ruin your game if you don’t get CBT fast enough, and even then… – Try the Alice Midnight loop, cause thier hand sucks.

**Pale Moon** – Mirror

**Narukami**

**Gold Paladin**

**Angel Feathers**
