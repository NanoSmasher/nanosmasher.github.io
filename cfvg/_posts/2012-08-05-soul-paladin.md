#### Woah there! This is a REALLY outdated post. For more current and accurate articles visit my [main page](/cfvg).

<p>The soul was presented in a new light when Soul Saver Dragon went into the scene. With an explosion of power that seemed relatively easy, she became a hallmark in many RP decks. Even in RP&#8217;s meta, SSD is a final turn option with great opportunity. However, there were plenty of other options other then SSD.</p>
<p>A neat alternative to the classic RP formula existed, and so soul paladins were created.</p>
<p><strong>Idea</strong><br />
Using Royal Paladin&#8217;s lacking resource. Mix in various options and pressure that ranges from retiring rearguards to gaining massive power boosts.</p>
<p><strong>General Advantages</strong><br />
21k rows from soulcharging.<br />
Apart from that, it is pretty much the only RP deck that is not reliant on Toypugal, hence grade 3&#8217;s, to maintain a good row. Six boosters are 9k, four 8k; a very consistent setup.</p><!-- more -->
<p><strong>General Disadvantages</strong><br />
Soul Saver Dragon works exactly opposite of Lohengrin. The sole reason is Young Pegasus Knight. Three&#8217;s a crowd, but there isn&#8217;t any better way to use the soul. Speaking of that, soul paladins are more technical and more things can go wrong especailly when Lohengrin is not the vanguard.</p>

<p><strong>Breakdown</strong><br />
<em>Demon Slaying Knight, Lohengrin</em> is your main vanguard. The soul charge ability is crucial for your effects to take place.<br />
<em>Soul Saver Dragon</em> The final turn option.<br />
<em>Blaster Blade</em> The killing machine, if you feel Lohengrin isn&#8217;t going to Megablast.<br />
<em>Knight of Silence, Gallatin</em> Staple for early damage/defense.<br />
<em>Great Sage, Baron</em> 11k for us when we have Lohengrin.<br />
<em>Young Pegasus Knight</em> The rumored legendary 18k rearguard. Unfourtunately, we miss Barcgal.<br />
<em>Pongal</em> Don&#8217;t use it if you can help it. I put one less Grade 3 though, since Pongal can be a neat little savior.<br />
<em>Stardust Trumpeter</em> It&#8217;s better to use this then to use our triggers.<br />
<em>Yggrasil Maiden, Elaine</em> Healing for chances to Megablast. Lied, really for BB to use a third time.<br />
<em>Bringer of Good Luck, Epona </em>Luck will never stop.<br />
<em>Margal</em> Only use ONCE. ONCE on the final turn. Any other times, and it&#8217;s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong><br />
Ride Lohengrin. Either:<br />
1) Use BB and SSD to use up the resources<br />
2) Megablast</p>
<p>For the final turn, you must have Soul Saver Dragon AND Margal. Declaring it without having both essential pieces brings a huge possibility of failure. The columns you create only work because Lohengrin&#8217;s ability gives them power, but SSD reverses that. In order tobring up the columns, you need Margals soulcharge. Aim all 20000+ attacks on the vanguard and win.</p>
<p>If you use Lohengrin&#8217;s Megablast, then obviously you can&#8217;t do anything with SSD. But you pretty much won, didn&#8217;t you?.</p>
<p><strong>Columns</strong><br />
Baron and Young Pegasus knight seems to defy the magic number law. But it&#8217;s ability keeps them alive. With a consistent soulcharge by Lohengrin, we are able to go from 14000 to 20000 every turn. And assuming you have the final turn set up correctly, Margal can provide that boost plus a little extra have we gotten ourselves a 11k and up vanguard.</p>
<p>Same goes with a YPK behind Lohengrin. 16k becomes 21k with both abilities, but SSD swings at 19k. Margal then brings it up to 22k for a reasonable number.</p>
<p><strong>Variations</strong><br />
None to speak of.</p>

4 <span style="color:#ff0000;">Alabaster Owl</span> [CRIT]</p>
<p><strong>Breakdown</strong><br />
<em>Knight of Explosive Flames, Palamedes </em>Minus Soul Saver&#8217;s gambit, Plus Palamedes consistency. With 10 boosters to reach 21k+, Palamedes will never stop.<br />
<em>Marhaus </em>Amazingly, if you don&#8217;t have enough to afford Palamedes Marhausis good as those 10 boosters Palamedes has access to are all 9k. Palamedes however is better if you have the chance.<br />
<em>Borgal </em>No Soul Saver, then we don&#8217;t need Pongal.<br />
<em>Alabaster Owl </em>With consistent 21k rows every turn, crits assure they feel the pain of guarding much earlier then expected.</p>
<p><strong>Strategy</strong><br />
Call 9k boosters, soulcharge with Lohengrin and start pressuring. Guard Palamedes/Marhaus as constant power is better then saving cards. Blaster Blade to get the last piece of advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Variations</strong><br />
What happened to Margal? It&#8217;s because it is misused so easily. It is a nice card depending on the situation. In one scenario, a normal use where a unit increases by half of the magic number line, YPK allows the boost to reach past it, which is worth it since the opponent has to use \5/ more when you your self lost a \5/. With a Baron/YPK line, Lohengrin+Margal can bring the line up to 26k, persuming Margal&#8217;s boost power wass placed on the opposite column. Margal is a great technical card, but most begineers mismanage its effect, so I replaced it with crits. If you are technical enough you may try it, but a simple crit fest is easy.</p>
<p>I just know you want to tech in Soul Saver Dragon. Don&#8217;t. Since 6 of your 10 viable boosters is dependant on constant soulcharging, you may take off your rearguard 21k columns and replace them for the exact same amount to guard with (maybe 24k if you are lucky).</p>

4 Alabaster Owl [CRIT]</p>
<p><strong>Breakdown</strong><br />
<em>Uncompromising Knight, Idell </em>While most people have turned away from this staple in favor of better 12k attackers, Idell is promising because of the wealth of 9k boosters. So either being a consistent attacker (17k) or a pseudo-Marhaus (21k), Idell makes the best uses counterblasts we have. No need to rely on Palamedes to dish out damage!<br />
<em>Dreaming Jewel Knight, Tiffany </em>It can move out then back in (choosing 0 Jewel Knights), so you can exert early pressure then whisk it away before dropping a stronger unit. YPK and Baron obviously get a minor boost from it. Nothing much, but better then sitting on Stardust Trumpeter.<br />
<em>Blazing Jewel Knight, Rachelle</em> The jewel knights are added just to make it sexier.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Soul paladins are more technical then a normal RP deck. But in the face of consistency and power these cards have stuck to it. If you are looking for very aggresive power even before Limit Break, and only need to rely on one card (Which is a plus, since many decks need to focus on more then one) then pick up your spirits and join the demon slaying knights. <i class="fa fa-stop"></i></p>
